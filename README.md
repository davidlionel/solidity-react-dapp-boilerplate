# Simple React & Solidity Dapp Boilerplate

This is the boilerplate I'm currently using, put together based on a few other starters. Feel free to use.

Install the Boilerplate using 'git clone'

'git clone https://github.com/davidlionel/solidity-react-dapp-boilerplate.git'


Then use 'npm' to install the dependencies

'npm install'
